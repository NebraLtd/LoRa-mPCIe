# LoRa-mPCIe
Open source mPCIe LoRa® concentrators from Nebra

## Branches

This repo contains a number of branches with different versions of the LoRa mPCIe hardware as set out below.

### Main

The [main branch of this repo](https://github.com/NebraLtd/LoRa-mPCIe) contains the initial design of the SX1302/3 concentrator but it is based on the original version of the Semtech reference design. It is therefore outdated and is here just for reference purposes. **This hardware has not been verified with prototypes. We do not recommend you use this design.**

### v1.1

The [v1.1 branch of this repo](https://github.com/NebraLtd/LoRa-mPCIe/tree/v1.1) is the latest version of the SX1302/3 based LoRa concentrator design, based on the v3 Semtech Corecell reference design.

There are multiple variants (USB/SPI versions, GNSS/no-GNSS versions and different frequency options). Visit the [v1.1 README](https://github.com/NebraLtd/LoRa-mPCIe/blob/v1.1/README.md) for more information on the different hardware versions and how to produce them.

### 470/433

In the future, we will have our 470 MHz and 433 MHz designs available as well. As the design differs considerably from the 868/915 versions it may be in a separate branch.

## Open Source Hardware Certification
