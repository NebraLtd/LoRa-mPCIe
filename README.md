# LoRa-mPCIe
Open source mPCIe LoRaÂ® concentrators from Nebra

## Branches

This repo contains a number of branches with different versions of the LoRa mPCIe hardware as set out below.

### Main

The [main branch of this repo](https://github.com/NebraLtd/LoRa-mPCIe) contains the initial design of the SX1302/3 concentrator but it is based on the original version of the Semtech reference design. It is therefore outdated and is here just for reference purposes. **This hardware has not been verified with prototypes. We do not recommend you use this design.**

### v1.1

The [v1.1 branch of this repo](https://github.com/NebraLtd/LoRa-mPCIe/tree/v1.1) is the latest version of the SX1302/3 based LoRa concentrator design, based on the v3 Semtech Corecell reference design.

There are multiple variants (USB/SPI versions, GNSS/no-GNSS versions and different frequency options). Visit the [v1.1 VARIANTS file](https://github.com/NebraLtd/LoRa-mPCIe/blob/v1.1/VARIANTS.md) for more information on the different hardware versions and how to produce them.

### v1.2
The development can be followed on the v1.2 branch but keeping the branch unmerged to master would create issues as branches generally accepted as unstable. Also the design will be ended with v1.2 from various reasons (Branding issues with Semtech, semantic versioning does not work in hardware design as in software development)

The variant files also can be observed in the Output's folder under their respective folders.

Note: Successor of this design will appear soon in another repo.

### 470/433

In the future, we will have our 470 MHz and 433 MHz designs available as well. As the design differs considerably from the 868/915 versions it may be in a separate branch.

## Open Source Hardware Certification
